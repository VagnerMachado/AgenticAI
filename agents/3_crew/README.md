# CrewAI Projects

This directory contains various projects built using the [crewAI](https://crewai.com) framework. These projects demonstrate how to set up and run multi-agent AI systems for different purposes.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects in this directory:

- **coder**: A crew of AI agents designed for coding tasks. They can collaborate to write, debug, and review code.

- **debate-original**: A crew of AI agents that can engage in a debate on a given topic, with each agent taking a different stance.

- **engineering_team**: A crew of AI agents that mimics an engineering team, including roles like a project manager, senior engineer, and QA engineer.

- **financial_researcher**: A crew of AI agents designed to perform financial research and analysis.

- **stock_picker**: A crew of AI agents that can analyze stocks and provide recommendations.


## Getting Started

Each project is a self-contained `crewAI` application. To run any of the projects, navigate to the project's directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

Generally, you will need to have Python installed, install the required dependencies using `uv` or `pip`, and then run the project using `crewai run`.
