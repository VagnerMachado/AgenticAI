My name is Vagner Machado And I was born in Brazil in the small farm in southern most state of the country. My parents were farmers and since young age I was fascinated by technology. For example, I Still remember the awe when I saw the first color TV and I did not believe that internet could be wireless when my friends showed my their laptops browsing the internet without any wires attached. Coming from a family with limited resources gave me the extra desire to excel and grow. I moved to the US just after i graduated high school, given that i did not have many opportunities there as college was a very expensive idea to pursue. In the US i worked in construction - which i used to do also in Brazil with my father at an young age - and mastered many skills till I became an independent contractor, and responsible for the planning and development of several multi million properties in New England. After some years, the thought of pursuing the old dream of a tech related carreer started to take my thoughts again. I went back to college and graduated with Summa Cum Laude honors from Nassau Community College and CUNY Queens college. Currently i an a senior software engineer at Citi, responsible for many services that interact with Merchants and Payment enablers for CitiPay. In my free time i like to stay on the loop with latest tech, go to the gym, bike rides, hikes, gym, hit the beach in the summer and snowboard in the winter. I love animals although i dont have any.
